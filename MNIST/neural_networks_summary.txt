Neural Networks Summary

1. Basics of Neural Networks
- Composed of layers (input, hidden, output) with interconnected nodes or neurons.
- Activation functions (ReLU, softmax) introduce non-linearity, enabling complex pattern learning.

2. Training Process
- Forward Propagation: Passing input data through the network to generate predictions.
- Backpropagation: Computing gradients of the loss function to update weights.
- Optimizer: Adjusts weights to minimize the loss function (e.g., Adam, SGD).

3. Overfitting and Generalization
- Overfitting: Model learns training data too well, performing poorly on unseen data.
- Generalization: Model's ability to perform well on new, unseen data.
- Combat overfitting with data augmentation, regularization (L1, L2), dropout, early stopping.

4. Regularization Techniques
- Dropout: Randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training.
- L1/L2 Regularization: Adds penalties on weights to encourage simpler models.

5. Model Evaluation
- Training vs. evaluation accuracy difference can indicate overfitting.
- Validation set use during training monitors performance and guides adjustments.

6. Early Stopping
- Stops training when a monitored metric (e.g., validation loss) stops improving.
- Parameters include `patience` and `restore_best_weights`.

7. Experimentation and Tuning
- Adjust model architecture, learning rate, and hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Systematic experimentation and result tracking are crucial.

This summary encapsulates key neural network concepts, training, overfitting prevention, and performance improvement strategies.
